# Flask Synopsis Generator

The Flask Synopsis Generator is a web application built with Flask that generates synopses from provided URLs. It allows users to select different tones for the synopsis and extracts key words, making it versatile for various content creation and summarization needs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Python can be downloaded from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://yourproject/repository.git
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment for the project. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them.

   To create a virtual environment, navigate to the project directory and run:

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command installs all the necessary packages as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the Application

With the dependencies installed, you're ready to run the application.

1. **Start the Flask Application**

   In the project directory, with your virtual environment activated, start the Flask application by running:

   ```
   flask run
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**

   After starting the application, it will be accessible in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Features

- **URL Synopsis Generation**: Generate a synopsis from a provided URL.
- **Tone Selection**: Choose the tone of the synopsis from options such as general, technical, school report, or blog.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract key words from the generated synopsis for quick content overview.
